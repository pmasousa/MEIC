## Lecture 1: Foundations of Agent Systems

### 1. What is an Agent?

- **Definition:** A computer system capable of autonomous action in some environment to meet its design objectives.
- **Core Loop:**

  1. **Sense** (perceive environment via sensors)
  2. **Decide** (choose an action)
  3. **Act** (perform via effectors)
  4. Repeat…

  - _See “Agent–Environment Interaction” diagram on Slide 3._

### 2. Intelligent Agents & Their Properties

## Lecture 3: Agent Architectures

### A. Abstract Model

- **Environment:** ⟨E (states), e₀ (initial), τ (state-transition)⟩
- **Agent:** function Ag: runs_of_percepts → actions
- **Runs:** sequences e₀, α₀, e₁, α₁, …

### B. Deductive (Symbolic) Agents

- **Paradigm:** knowledge base + theorem-prover.
- **Key Problems:**

  1. **Transduction:** real-world → symbols.
  2. **Representation/Reasoning:** storing and logically inferring info.

- **Action Selection:** prove Do(a) from database (DB ⊢ρ Do(a)).
- **Example:** Vacuum world (3×3 grid with Dirt/Null percepts).

  - _See Vacuum-World grid on Slide …_

### C. Intentional (BDI) Agents

- **Mental States:**

  - **Beliefs** (what’s true)
  - **Desires** (goals)
  - **Intentions** (committed goals)

- **Practical Reasoning:**

  1. **Deliberation:** filter desires → intentions.
  2. **Means–Ends:** plan to achieve intentions.

- **Components:** belief revision, option generation, filter, planning.
- **Commitment Strategies:** blind, single-minded, open-minded.

  - _See BDI control-loop diagram on Slide …_

### D. Reactive Agents

- **Principle:** behavior emerges from simple stimulus–response rules.
- **Purely Reactive:** no internal memory—action = f(percept).
- **Brooks’ Subsumption:** layered FSMs, where lower-level behaviors inhibit higher ones.

  - _Refer to Subsumption hierarchy on Slide …_

### E. Hybrid Architectures

- **Goal:** combine reactive robustness with deliberative planning.
- **Layering Styles:**

  - **Horizontal:** each layer sees sensors/actuators, votes on actions.
  - **Vertical:** separate perception, deliberation, action layers.

- **Case Study:** DARPA Grand Challenge winner “Stanley” (laser, radar, vision → real-time navigation + planning).

  - _See Stanley’s sensor rack on Slide …_

## Lecture 4: Multiagent Decision Making & Game Theory

### 1. Normal-Form Games

- **Definition:** (N players, action sets Ai, payoff functions ui).
- **Joint Action:** a = (a₁,…,aₙ) → each ui(a) real-valued.

### 2. Prisoner’s Dilemma

- Two players choose Cooperate/Defect → payoff matrix with T>R>P>S.
- **Key insight:** mutual defection is Nash equilibrium but suboptimal.

### 3. Dominance & Elimination

- **Strictly Dominated Action:** always worse than another, regardless of opponents.
- **Iterated Elimination:** repeatedly remove dominated actions (assumes common-knowledge rationality).

  - **Drawbacks:** heavy knowledge assumptions; may not converge to unique outcome.

### 4. Nash Equilibrium (NE)

- **Definition:** no player can unilaterally improve payoff by deviating.
- **Best Response:** BRᵢ(a₋ᵢ) = {aᵢ | ui(aᵢ,a₋ᵢ) ≥ ui(aᵢ′,a₋ᵢ) ∀aᵢ′}.
- **Finding NE:** scan all joint actions and check mutual best responses.

  - _See payoff matrix with underlined NE payoffs on Slide …_

## Lecture 5: Auctions

### Canonical Formats

- **English (Ascending):** open‐outcry, price starts at reserve and bidders shout higher offers; ends when time expires, selling at the last bid.
- **Dutch (Descending):** clock begins high and ticks down; first bidder to accept the current price wins at that price.
- **First-Price Sealed-Bid:** everyone submits one secret bid; highest bidder wins and pays their bid.
- **Second-Price (Vickrey):** highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid.

### Bidding Behavior

- **First-Price:** bid below your true value to trade off winning probability vs. surplus.
- **Second-Price:** truthful bidding is a dominant strategy.

### Revenue Equivalence

Under independent private values and risk neutrality, all standard auctions yield the same expected revenue. In an $n$-bidder first-price auction, the symmetric equilibrium bidding function is:

$$
b(v_i) \;=\; \frac{n-1}{n}\,v_i
$$

_(See Slides 52–59 for the full derivation.)_

## Lecture 6: Social Choice & Voting

### Setting

- A set of outcomes; agents have (privately known) preference rankings.
- Goal: a social choice function mapping profiles to a winning outcome.

### Non-Ranking Schemes

- **Plurality:** select outcome with most first-place votes.
- **Approval:** each voter approves any number of candidates; pick highest approval count.
- **Cumulative:** fixed vote budget distributed among choices.&#x20;

### Ranking Schemes

- **Instant-Runoff (IRV):** eliminate last-place candidate repeatedly until one remains.
- **Borda Count:** assign $n-1$ points to top choice down to 0; sum and pick highest.
- **Pairwise Elimination:** pre-defined bracket of head-to-head runoffs.&#x20;

### Key Properties & Paradoxes

- **Condorcet Criterion:** if a candidate beats all others pairwise, they should win (but may not exist).
- **Example Cycle (A > B > C > A)** leads to no Condorcet winner.
- **D’Hondt Method:** proportional seat allocation by highest quotients $V/(s+1)$&#x20;
- **Gerrymandering:** manipulating district boundaries can overturn proportionality&#x20;

## Lecture 7: Bayesian Games

### First Definition (Information Sets)

A Bayesian game is $(N, G, P, I)$:

- $G$: set of games differing only in payoffs
- $P$: common prior over $G$
- $I_i$: partition of $G$ representing what agent $i$ can distinguish&#x20;

### Second Definition (Types)

Equivalently, $(N, A, Θ, p, u)$:

- $Θ_i$: type space for agent $i$
- $p$: prior over type profiles
- $u_i(a, θ)$: payoff given joint action $a$ and types $θ$

### Solution Concept

- **Bayesian Nash Equilibrium:** each agent’s strategy $\alpha_i: Θ_i→A_i$ maximizes expected payoff given beliefs about others’ types&#x20;
- **Belief Stages:**

  - _Ex-ante:_ no one knows any types
  - _Interim:_ agent knows own type
  - _Ex-post:_ all types revealed

---

## Lecture 8: Extensive-Form Games

### Model

- Game tree with chance and decision nodes, information sets, terminal payoffs.

### Strategies & Equilibria

- **Normal-Form Equivalent:** enumerate contingent plans at each information set.
- **Nash Equilibrium:** no unilateral deviations profitable.

### Subgame-Perfect Equilibrium (SPE)

- SPE is a strategy profile that induces a Nash equilibrium in every subgame.
- **Backward Induction:** start from terminal nodes and prune non-credible threats&#x20;

---

## Lecture 9: Repeated Games & Folk Theorem

### Repeated Games

- **Stage Game:** same normal form played each period.
- **Finitely Repeated:** backward induction → unique SPNE = play one-shot Nash each round.
- **Infinitely Repeated:** history-dependent strategies; payoffs discounted by $\beta$.

### Strategies

- **Tit-for-Tat:** start Cooperate; mimic opponent’s last move.
- **Trigger:** cooperate until a defection, then defect forever.
- Any profile of one-shot NE repeated is subgame-perfect.

### Folk Theorem (Infinite Horizon)

If $\mathbf{a}$ is a one-shot NE and $\mathbf{a}'$ yields strictly higher payoffs for all, then for sufficiently high discount factors $\beta$, there exists an SPE of the repeated game sustaining $\mathbf{a}'$ every period.

- Key condition: $\beta_i ≥ \frac{M}{M+m}$, where

  - $M$ = max one-period gain from deviating
  - $m$ = min one-period loss from future punishment

## Lecture 10: Evolutionary & Large-Population Models

### Replicator Dynamics

- Population state $\theta_t(a)$ = fraction playing $a$.
- Payoff to $a$: $u_t(a)=\sum_b \theta_t(b)\,u(a,b)$.
- Dynamics: $\dot\theta_t(a)=\theta_t(a)\bigl(u_t(a)-\bar u_t\bigr)$&#x20;

### Equilibrium Concepts

- **Steady State:** $\dot\theta=0$.
- **Stable / Asymptotically Stable:** small perturbations remain close / return over time.
- **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS):** resist invasion by mutants&#x20;

---

## Lecture 11: MDPs & Reinforcement Learning

### Markov Decision Processes

- Tuple $(S,A,P,R,\gamma)$; goal: find policy $\pi$ maximizing discounted return.
- **Value Iteration:**

  $$
    Q(s,a) \leftarrow R(s,a)+\gamma\sum_{s'}P(s'\!\mid s,a)\max_{a'}Q(s',a')
    ,\quad V(s)=\max_a Q(s,a)
  $$

- Converges to optimal $Q^*$ and policy $\pi^*$&#x20;

### Model-Free RL: Q-Learning

- Interact: observe $(s,a,r,s')$; update

  $$
    Q(s,a)\gets Q(s,a)+\alpha\bigl[r+\gamma\max_{a'}Q(s',a')-Q(s,a)\bigr]
  $$

- Converges under exploration conditions&#x20;

---

## Lecture 12: Multiagent Learning & Markov Games

### Stochastic (Markov) Games

- Generalization of MDPs to $n$ agents: state transitions depend on joint actions; each has payoff function.

### Learning Paradigms

- **Independent Learners:** treat others as part of environment.
- **Joint-Action Learners:** observe others’ actions; learn equilibria-based updates.
- **Agent Modelling:** build explicit models of others.
- **Centralized:** single learner controlling all agents.

### Case Studies

- **AlphaStar (DeepMind):** MARL in StarCraft II.
- **MARLÖ Competition:** learning in Minecraft environments.&#x20;

---

## Lecture 13: Social Conventions & Coordination Graphs

### Social Conventions

- Pre-agreed recipes (rules) to select one Pareto-optimal NE in coordination games.
- **With Communication:** fix agent ordering; each broadcasts chosen action in turn&#x20;

### Coordination Graphs

- Decompose global payoff $u(a)$ into sum of local functions $f_j$ over small subsets of agents.
- Solve via message-passing over graph structure for scalable coordination&#x20;

---

## Lecture 14: Roles & Communication

### Roles

- Pre-define roles (e.g. Attacker, Goalkeeper, Defender) to prune agents’ action sets.
- **Potential Functions:** assign each agent–role utility (e.g. $-$distance to goal) and pick role maximizing potential&#x20;

### Role Assignment Algorithms

- **Greedy (No Communication):** each agent computes all potentials, then independently picks best (may conflict).
- **With Communication:** each broadcasts own potentials; all agree on global optimum assignment.&#x20;

### Coordination Graphs Revisited

- Apply role-based subgames or full coordination graphs for large teams.
