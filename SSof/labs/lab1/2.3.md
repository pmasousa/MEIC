Perfect! Let’s go **step by step** using the Hasse diagram you provided. I’ll first **draw it clearly in text**, then define the policy.

## **Step 1 — Hasse diagram (ASCII version)**

Your diagram:

```
      ABC      ABD
        \     /
          AB
         /  \
        A    B
```

- **Bottom layer:** `A`, `B`
- **Middle layer:** `AB`
- **Top layer:** `ABC`, `ABD`

Edges go **upwards** — flow is allowed from lower to higher nodes.

---

## **(a) Define the information flow policy**

### **Set of security classes `SC`**

[
SC = {A, B, AB, ABC, ABD}
]

### **Can-flow relation `−◮`**

Flow is **upwards in the Hasse diagram** (from lower to higher classes):

```
A −◮ AB
B −◮ AB
AB −◮ ABC
AB −◮ ABD
A −◮ ABC   (transitive)
A −◮ ABD   (transitive)
B −◮ ABC   (transitive)
B −◮ ABD   (transitive)
AB −◮ AB   (reflexive)
ABC −◮ ABC
ABD −◮ ABD
```

Or more compactly:

- `A` can flow to `{AB, ABC, ABD}`
- `B` can flow to `{AB, ABC, ABD}`
- `AB` can flow to `{ABC, ABD}`
- Each node can flow to itself

---

### **Join operator `⊕`**

- `⊕` is the **least upper bound** of two classes in the Hasse diagram.
- Problem: For example:

```
A ⊕ B = ?
```

- There is no **single least upper bound** for `A` and `B` — both `ABC` and `ABD` are above `AB`? Actually, AB is above both A and B, so **AB is the LUB of A and B**.

Check some examples:

| Pair     | ⊕                     |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| A, B     | AB                    |
| A, AB    | AB                    |
| B, AB    | AB                    |
| AB, ABC  | ABC                   |
| AB, ABD  | ABD                   |
| ABC, ABD | ? (no LUB in diagram) |

- **Issue:** The join operator is **undefined for some pairs** — for example, `ABC ⊕ ABD` has no single least upper bound (they are incomparable above AB).

So the original diagram **does not define `⊕` for all pairs**.

---

## **(b) Extend diagram so `⊕` is always defined**

- We need a **complete lattice**: every pair of nodes has a **unique least upper bound**.
- Add a **top element `ABCD`** (or `Top`) above both `ABC` and `ABD`.

ASCII Hasse diagram:

```
       ABCD
      /    \
   ABC      ABD
      \    /
        AB
       /  \
      A    B
```

- Now **every pair has a unique join**:

| Pair      | ⊕    |
| --------- | ---- |
| ABC, ABD  | ABCD |
| A, B      | AB   |
| AB, ABC   | ABC  |
| AB, ABD   | ABD  |
| ABC, ABCD | ABCD |

- The lattice is now **complete**, so `⊕` is defined for all pairs. ✅

---

### ✅ Summary of extended policy

- **SC (classes):** `{A, B, AB, ABC, ABD, ABCD}`
- **Can-flow relation `−◮`:** any class can flow **upwards in the lattice**
- **Join operator `⊕`:** least upper bound in the lattice — now defined for all pairs because of `ABCD`

---

If you want, I can **draw a clean diagram with all edges labeled** and the join operator table, ready to include in a lab report. This will make it crystal clear which classes can flow to which.

Do you want me to do that?
