    "Once the last step is reached the game is won.\n",
    "A stop action will stop again but a go action will reset the game to the initial state corresponding to the level 0 and safe level 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first activity, you will implement your Markov chain model in Python. You will start by loading the transition probability matrix from a `numpy` binary file, using the `numpy` function `load`. You will then consider the state space to consist of all valid indices for the loaded transition matrix, each represented as a string. For example, if the transition probability matrix is $20\\times 20$, the states should include the strings `'0'` to `'19'`."
